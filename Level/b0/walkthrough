in p() fonction they
replace first '\n' by '\0'
and take first 20 char.

in pp() fonction they 
join both string give
and add a space between.

in main() fonction they 
store strings and display
the new string

by giving a string of more
than 20 char '\0' is not set
at end of string.
so strlen and strcat miss this
end. Whereof we can overwrite
main adress retrun.

start of joined string
is 0x36 upstream return.
First part of this pad is
the both strings and a space,
that lead us to 41 on 54 char
needed, remain 13 char to the 
goal. put our adress at second
string and 13. fill the rest
without null byte.

adress of our shellcode gived in 
environement.
