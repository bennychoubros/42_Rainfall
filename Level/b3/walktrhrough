The program take 1 parameter, and use it two time.
Firstly in atoi and secondly in strcmp.
atoi will return a value use as an index to set at zero 
a char of string 

but atoi return if it found nothing.

so strcmp will compare unknow value to our parameter

if parameter one is a null string,
atoi will return 0 and set 0 at start of his string.

because our both string are egal we can pass if condition 
and access to sub shell.

well done
