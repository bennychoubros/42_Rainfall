3 calls :	-atoi
		-memcpy
		-execl

Excel is our goal.
But it need some condition
to access it. if one atoi 
need to return something
under 0x9. And after memcpy,
where the returned value was
stored need to be 0x574f4c46

atoi is use to set the lengh
of memcpy.
and memcpy will copy second
parameter gived to the program
upstream where the atoi return
is stored.
