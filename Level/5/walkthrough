aim : redirect call 

exit call to o() fonction in n() fonction.

fgets and printf as previous level.

so need to replace at 0x080484ff	: e8 cc fe ff ff  (call exit)
		   by	 		: e8 a1 ff ff ff  (call -91(o()))


they sub esp by 0x218, and start write at esp add 0x200.
So 0x18 mean 24 in decimal, adresses are on 4 octet, 6*4 = 24
6th args

padding for a1			: 161
size of injection		: 7
padding for ff			: 95
size of second injection	: 7

lengh of the string
161 + 7 + 95 + 7 = 268

find args padding args generate by the string
268 / 4 = 67


start of args
67 + 6 = 73 

## an other way was more simple, by put adresses at the start of the string,
## so the arg start would be 6.
