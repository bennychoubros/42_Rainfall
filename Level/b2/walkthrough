Program input:
	This program requiere 2 prarameters,
	about first parameter, over 40 bytes
	remaining will be ignor.
	and about second parameter, it's over
	32 bytes.

Set original string:
	First of all it will take an area of
	40 bytes, and set it to zero.
	Secondly, set first parameter in, at 
	offset 0, with a maximum of 40 bytes
	write.
	Thirdly, set second parameter in, at
	offset 40, with a maximum of 32 bytes
	write.

Intersting behavior:
	If first part of the original string 
	is fully filled, it will considered
	as one unique string. And from two 
	string limited, we can reach a string
	of 72 in a row.

Environment check:
	The language value is depending of
	environment "LANG", "nl" will set 2,
	"fi" will set 1, any other will result
	0

Set second string:
	this will be copied from orginal string
	until null value and with maximum lengh
	of 76 (because 19 run of 4 bytes copied
	at times)

Greetuser fonction:
	they create third 72 wide string.
	Then fill it with a string depending on 
	"Environment check".
	Only size of the string set is important.
	env=1 = 18 wide.
	env=2 = 13 wide.
	env=0 = 5  wide.
	At end of this string will be add the
	"second string", then display with puts.

Naughty behavior:
	So we can fill a string of 72 byte with
	an other string of 72 bytes. But we won't
	start at offset 0, but end of the 3th string 
	already here.
	We can overflow of the lengh of the third
	string.
	At end we need 4 bytes to go through ebp
	and 4 bytes more to write adress.
