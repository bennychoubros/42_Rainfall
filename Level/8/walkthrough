by reversing level8 we discovered 
four commands:	- "auth "
		- "reset"
		- "service "
		- "login"

Auth did a malloc of 4 and set it
to 0.

Reset free last malloc.

Service did an strdup of the following string.

Login display "Password:"



But in login they are also a comparison.
That check if there is something at
auth store more 32 octet, that comparison
block a call to system.


we need to find how witre at auth + 32.

Each malloc are followed so we need to do
several malloc, that could work because 
nothing stop us to did a new call
and nothing free older one.

Auth set the start point and write nothing,
so last entry possible, is by service,
write a string long enough.

job done congratulation
