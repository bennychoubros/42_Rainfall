it look like an oriented-object code
like cpp or c#

first step they alloc 2 area of 108 bits

then they did a memcpy of first param's program

without any control of overflow

so over 108 we step on second area start.

and guess what they call an adress store
at the second area start.

we need to write 108 char to filled first zone
then write the adress of a shellcode
